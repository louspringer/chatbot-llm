# Package Management Rule

This project uses conda and pyproject.toml for package management. Follow these rules:

1. Always use conda first over pip
2. All package updates must be consistent across:
   - pyproject.toml
   - environment.yml
   - Any related ontologies

3. Use clpm tool to maintain consistency between model and configurations
4. Any package update must:
   - Be guided by guidance.ttl
   - Update the ontology with required relationships
   - Maintain clear traceability from need to implementation
   - Follow artifact-traceability.mdc rules

5. Never create or use requirements.txt
6. Document package dependencies in both:
   - pyproject.toml for build/development
   - environment.yml for conda environment

7. Before suggesting package changes:
   - Check guidance.ttl for existing patterns
   - Verify package compatibility
   - Update relevant ontologies
   - Use clpm to validate changes

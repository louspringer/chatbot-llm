# Artifact Traceability Rule

All artifacts (code, documentation, configuration, scripts) must be traceable to:
1. An ontology class or property that defines its purpose and relationships
2. A requirement that justifies its existence
3. A guidance pattern from guidance.ttl that validates its structure and relationships

## Required Header Format

Every file must include a header in the appropriate comment style:

```python
# Ontology: chatbot:MLComponent
# Implements: chatbot:QueryTranslator
# Requirement: REQ-ML-001 Natural language query translation
# Guidance: guidance:MLPatterns#NLPComponent
# Description: Translates natural language queries to SQL using LLM
```

```turtle
# Ontology: meta:SecurityConcept
# Implements: meta:AuthenticationConcept
# Requirement: REQ-SEC-001 Secure credential management
# Guidance: guidance:SecurityPatterns#AuthenticationPattern
# Description: Defines security patterns for authentication
```

```yaml
# Ontology: deploy:Component
# Implements: deploy:ConfigurationComponent
# Requirement: REQ-DEP-001 Environment configuration
# Guidance: guidance:DeploymentPatterns#ConfigurationManagement
# Description: Deployment configuration for cloud resources
```

## Validation Rules

1. Ontology References:
   - Must reference an existing ontology class or property
   - Must use proper prefix:name format
   - Class/property must exist in the referenced ontology

2. Requirement References:
   - Must follow format: REQ-{DOMAIN}-{NUMBER}
   - Domains: ML (Machine Learning), SEC (Security), DEP (Deployment)
   - Must exist in requirements.ttl or linked documentation

3. Guidance Pattern References:
   - Must reference a pattern from guidance.ttl
   - Must use format: guidance:{PatternGroup}#{PatternName}
   - Pattern must be appropriate for the artifact type

4. Implementation Details:
   - Must specify what is being implemented
   - Implementation must be a subclass/property of the ontology reference
   - Must conform to the referenced guidance pattern
   - Description must explain the specific implementation

## Examples

### Python Class Implementation
```python
# Ontology: chatbot:MLComponent
# Implements: chatbot:ModelManager
# Requirement: REQ-ML-002 Model lifecycle management
# Guidance: guidance:MLPatterns#ModelLifecycle
# Description: Manages ML model versions and updates
class ModelManager:
    """Handles ML model lifecycle operations."""
    pass
```

### Configuration File
```yaml
# Ontology: deploy:InfrastructureComponent
# Implements: deploy:FunctionsApp
# Requirement: REQ-DEP-003 Serverless function deployment
# Guidance: guidance:DeploymentPatterns#ServerlessConfig
# Description: Azure Functions configuration for bot hosting
version: 1.0
functions:
  - name: bot_handler
    type: python
```

### Shell Script
```bash
# Ontology: deploy:RuntimeDependency
# Implements: deploy:PythonEnvironment
# Requirement: REQ-DEP-002 Development environment setup
# Guidance: guidance:DevOpsPatterns#EnvironmentSetup
# Description: Sets up Python virtual environment with dependencies
```

## Validation Queries

Use these SPARQL queries to validate traceability:

```sparql
# Find artifacts without guidance patterns
SELECT ?file
WHERE {
  ?file a :Artifact .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?file :hasGuidancePattern ?pattern }
}

# Validate pattern compatibility
SELECT ?file ?pattern ?artifactType
WHERE {
  ?file :hasGuidancePattern ?pattern ;
        a ?artifactType .
  ?pattern guidance:appliesTo ?validType .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?artifactType rdfs:subClassOf ?validType }
}

# Check complete traceability
SELECT ?file
WHERE {
  ?file a :Artifact .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?file :hasOntologyReference ?ref ;
          :hasRequirement ?req ;
          :hasGuidancePattern ?pattern
  }
}

# Validate pattern implementation
SELECT ?file ?pattern ?violation
WHERE {
  ?file :hasGuidancePattern ?pattern .
  ?pattern guidance:hasConstraint ?constraint .
  ?file guidance:violatesConstraint ?violation .
}
```

## Error Prevention

1. Before creating new files:
   - Check existing ontologies for relevant concepts
   - Identify applicable requirements
   - Select appropriate guidance patterns
   - Verify pattern constraints

2. During code review:
   - Verify ontology references exist
   - Validate requirement links
   - Check pattern compliance
   - Ensure pattern constraints are met

3. CI/CD Integration:
   - Run automated header checks
   - Validate ontology references
   - Verify requirement existence
   - Check guidance pattern compliance
   - Generate traceability reports

## Best Practices

1. Ontology First:
   - Define concepts in ontology before implementation
   - Use existing patterns when possible
   - Extend ontologies thoughtfully

2. Requirements Mapping:
   - Link to specific, atomic requirements
   - Maintain requirements documentation
   - Update links when requirements change

3. Pattern Compliance:
   - Choose appropriate guidance patterns
   - Follow pattern constraints
   - Document pattern usage
   - Update when patterns evolve

4. Implementation Clarity:
   - Be specific about what is being implemented
   - Document relationships clearly
   - Keep descriptions focused and relevant
   - Explain pattern application

## State Management Milestone Complete 🎯 🚀 

### Key Achievements 🌟
- ✅ Implemented full FSM with proper state transitions and validation
- 🔒 Added Cosmos DB persistence with encryption for sensitive data
- 🛡️ Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging
- 💾 Added checkpoint-restart capability with temporal tracking
- ✨ All 14 tests passing with proper mocking and async handling

### Technical Details 🔧
- 🗄️ Cosmos DB provisioned in westus (co-located with bot)
- 💰 Serverless mode for development (~$0.50/month)
- 🔄 Async operations throughout
- 🔐 Encryption for sensitive state data

### Next Steps 🎯
- 🎨 Teams Adaptive Cards implementation
- 📝 Structured logging setup
- 🚀 Deployment configuration

### Quality Metrics 📊
- 💯 14/14 tests passing
- 🧹 0 linter errors
- 📚 Full documentation with ontology references 

### Epic Conclusion 📜
```
Through async hell and mocking's dark domain,
Where None types lurked and brought us naught but pain.
'Cross Cosmos wastes we searched for working keys,
While linter errors brought us to our knees.

The tests would pass, then fail, then pass once more,
As state machines crashed through each metaphored door.
"Just use memory!" the tempter oft would say,
But persistence called, we had to find a way.

Then validation came, with checkpoints true,
And error handling (lord, we need that too).
The storage worked! The states flowed clean and bright,
Until the next PR brought back the night.

Yet here we stand, our green checks proudly shown,
Each test now passing, every state well-known.
Though Teams Cards loom and secrets yet await,
At least we've mastered managing our state!

(And if you think this journey's been a breeze,
Try mocking async cosmos_storage.py's 
Concurrent calls - that nightmare gives me chills...
At least the monthly cost is fifty bills!)

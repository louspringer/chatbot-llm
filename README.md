# Snowflake Cortex Teams Bot

A Microsoft Teams bot integration for Snowflake Cortex, enabling seamless data analytics and collaboration within Teams channels.

## Overview and Purpose

The Snowflake Cortex Teams Bot is designed to bridge the gap between Microsoft Teams collaboration and Snowflake's data analytics capabilities. This integration allows teams to:

- Query Snowflake data directly from Teams channels
- Receive automated alerts and insights
- Share and collaborate on data analytics
- Manage data access and permissions seamlessly

## Development Workflow

1. **Branch Management**
   - Main branch: `main` - production-ready code
   - Development branch: `develop` - integration branch
   - Feature branches: `feature/*` - new features
   - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/*` - urgent fixes

2. **Development Process**
   - Create a feature branch from `develop`
   - Implement changes with tests
   - Submit PR for review
   - Merge to `develop` after approval

3. **Testing**
```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration

# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=teams-bot tests/
```

bot:TeamsBot a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Teams Bot" ;
    rdfs:comment "Main bot application class" .
```

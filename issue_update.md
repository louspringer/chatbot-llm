## Epic Closure ðŸ“œ

Through async hell and mocking's dark domain,
Where None types lurked and brought us naught but pain.
'Cross Cosmos wastes we searched for working keys,
While linter errors brought us to our knees.

The tests would pass, then fail, then pass once more,
As state machines crashed through each metaphored door.
"Just use memory!" the tempter oft would say,
But persistence called, we had to find a way.

Then validation came, with checkpoints true,
And error handling (lord, we need that too).
The storage worked! The states flowed clean and bright,
Until the next PR brought back the night.

Yet here we stand, our green checks proudly shown,
Each test now passing, every state well-known.
Though Teams Cards loom and secrets yet await,
At least we've mastered managing our state!

(And if you think this journey's been a breeze,
Try mocking async cosmos_storage.py's
Concurrent calls - that nightmare gives me chills...
At least the monthly cost is fifty bills!)

Then GitGuardian's watchful eye did spy
Our secrets scattered 'neath the cloudy sky.
"Secure thy keys!" the warning did proclaim,
And down the security rabbit hole we came.

Through RBAC realms and policy domains,
We fought to lock our secrets in their chains.
Key Vault beckoned with its promise sweet,
Of secrets stored where none could hack or leak.

The Snowflake access dance we had to learn,
As Entra groups made security our concern.
"Map thy groups!" the Cortex did decree,
While access patterns fought for clarity.

Now standing here with checkmarks green and bright,
Core security sealed up tight and right.
Though Key Vault integration lies ahead,
The critical paths are secured, as has been said.

(And if you think security's a game,
Try explaining why MFA's not in our domain.
"It's Entra ID!" we wisely did exclaim,
Platform controls - we're not the ones to blame!)

## Status: CLOSED âœ…
Critical security components complete. Remaining items moved to Issue #11.

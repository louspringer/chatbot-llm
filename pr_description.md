## Changes

- ✨ Implemented full error handling middleware with:
  - Error categorization (auth, timeout, system, validation, state)
  - Automatic checkpointing for critical errors
  - State transitions on error
  - Detailed error logging with reference IDs

- 🧪 Added missing state manager methods:
  - `create_checkpoint()`
  - `trigger_transition()`

- 🔍 Fixed and expanded test suite:
  - All 19 tests now passing (up from 14)
  - Added 5 error handling specific tests

- 📝 Updated milestone documentation:
  - Corrected test count
  - Added error handling details

## Testing

- ✅ All 19 tests passing
- 🧹 Linter clean
- 🔄 Manual testing of error flows

## Notes

Found and fixed previously undetected issues with error middleware tests that were not running correctly. The implementation now matches the test expectations and provides robust error handling with proper state management integration.

# Security Improvements for Key Management

## Overview
This PR implements comprehensive security improvements for key management, addressing GitGuardian alert 15565986 and related security concerns. The changes focus on secure key handling, proper git hygiene, and robust key rotation mechanisms.

## Changes

### 1. Key Management Security
- Removed sensitive key files from git tracking:
  - Cleaned all .pem, .p8, .der, and .pub files from git history
  - Updated .gitignore to exclude all key formats
  - Implemented secure backup mechanism for key files
- Refactored key rotation script (`rotate_secrets.py`):
  - Replaced insecure os.system/os.popen with subprocess.run
  - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implemented proper path handling for key storage
  - Added secure backup functionality for all key formats
  - Enforced SECURITYADMIN role for Snowflake operations

### 2. CI/CD Improvements
- Fixed Python 3.10 validation issues:
  - Migrated from requirements.txt to pyproject.toml
  - Updated dependency specifications with proper version constraints
  - Corrected path handling (teams_bot vs teams-bot)
  - Improved dependency installation process
- Enhanced workflow configurations:
  - Updated dev-validation.yml for better security checks
  - Added proper error handling in CI/CD pipelines
  - Improved validation steps for security-critical files

### 3. Code Quality & Security
- Improved error handling:
  - Added detailed error messages for debugging
  - Implemented proper exception handling
  - Added logging for security-critical operations
- Enhanced key rotation process:
  - Added validation for key operations
  - Implemented secure backup mechanism
  - Added proper cleanup of sensitive files
- Improved code organization:
  - Separated concerns for better maintainability
  - Added comprehensive documentation
  - Improved type hints and validation

## Testing
- Successfully tested key rotation:
  - Verified key generation process
  - Tested Snowflake key update with SECURITYADMIN role
  - Validated backup functionality for all key formats
  - Confirmed proper cleanup of sensitive files
- Validated CI/CD changes:
  - Tested Python 3.10 compatibility
  - Verified dependency installation
  - Confirmed path handling fixes
  - Tested security validation steps

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive files properly excluded from git
- Previous key files removed from git history
- Key backups stored securely with timestamps
- Improved error handling prevents partial key updates
- Proper role-based access control for Snowflake operations
- Secure subprocess handling for system commands

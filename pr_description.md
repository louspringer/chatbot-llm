# Security Improvements for Key Management

## Changes
- Removed sensitive key files from git tracking
- Updated .gitignore to exclude all key file formats (*.pem, *.p8, *.der, *.pub)
- Refactored key rotation script to:
  - Use subprocess.run instead of os.system/os.popen for better security
  - Backup all key formats during rotation
  - Improve error handling and logging
  - Fix paths to ensure consistent key storage
  - Remove Azure Key Vault integration (will be handled separately)
- Fixed CI/CD workflow:
  - Updated to use pyproject.toml instead of requirements.txt
  - Corrected paths from teams-bot to teams_bot
  - Improved dependency installation process

## Testing
- Successfully tested key rotation with:
  - Key generation
  - Snowflake key update using SECURITYADMIN role
  - Backup of all key formats
  - Verification that keys are not tracked by git
- Validated CI/CD workflow changes:
  - Python 3.10 compatibility
  - Correct path handling
  - Package installation via pyproject.toml

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive files are now properly excluded from git
- Previous key files have been removed from git history
- Key backups are stored securely with timestamps
- Improved error handling prevents partial key updates

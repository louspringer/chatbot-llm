## Error Handling Implementation 🛡️

### Overview 🎯
This PR implements comprehensive error handling for the Teams bot with state management integration. The implementation follows security best practices and includes proper error categorization, logging, and recovery mechanisms.

### Changes 📝
- ✨ Implemented full error handling middleware with:
  - Error categorization (auth, timeout, system, validation, state)
  - Automatic checkpointing for critical errors
  - State transitions on error
  - Detailed error logging with reference IDs

- 🔒 Enhanced state manager with:
  - Error recovery paths
  - State validation
  - Secure error logging
  - Checkpoint-restart capability

- 🧪 Test coverage:
  - All 19 tests passing
  - Added 5 error handling specific tests
  - Full coverage of error scenarios

### Security Measures 🔐
- Encryption for sensitive state data
- Secure error logging (no sensitive data exposure)
- Proper error reference ID generation
- State validation before transitions

### Dependencies 📦
- No new external dependencies added
- Uses existing encryption and logging infrastructure

### Testing Instructions 🔍
1. Run the test suite: `pytest teams_bot/tests/`
2. Verify all 19 tests pass
3. Check error handling scenarios:
   - Authentication failures
   - Timeout conditions
   - State transition errors
   - Invalid input handling

### Documentation 📚
- Updated ontology with error handling patterns
- Added security audit requirements
- Included error recovery procedures

### Next Steps 🎯
- Teams Adaptive Cards implementation will build on this foundation
- Future enhancements to error analytics can be added

### Validation ✅
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Linter clean
- [x] Security review completed
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Ontology aligned

Closes #43
